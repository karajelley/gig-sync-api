Freelancer Management Tool: Develop a tool for freelancers to manage their projects, clients, and finances. This app will include all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to:
 	
Create Projects: Users can add new projects, specify details like title, description, due date, client, and budget. 	
Manage Clients: Users can create a database of clients with contact information, project history, and notes. 	
Track Time: Implement a time tracking feature that allows users to log hours spent on each project. 	
Update Project Status: Users should be able to update the status of projects (e.g., in-progress, completed), edit project details, and mark milestones. 	
Invoice Generation: Allow users to create, update, and delete invoices for completed projects. Include payment status tracking. 	
Manage Finances: Users can add expenses and income related to each project, categorize them, and visualize their cash flow. 	
Dashboard: A dashboard to give an overview of ongoing projects, total earnings, outstanding payments, and upcoming deadlines. Include data visualization for easy understanding. 	
Authentication: Users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage their profile.
